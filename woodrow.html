<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Before this post gets taken down by Woodrow, I suggest (if you care at all) that you screenshot it or something, at least take it into consideration when doing anything regarding him.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Dates and times are NOT going to be 100% accurate, as Woodrow has archived the main Discord channel. My interpretation of the situation is exactly that, my interpretation so take dates and chronological inconsistencies with a grain of salt as I do not have access to any of the previous messages or anything.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">I am not disputing my ban here, I personally do not care that I was banned, I’m glad to finally separate myself from Woodrow and the other people in that server that I cant tolerate.</p>

<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=28 data-line-end=29 ><a id="The_Start_28"></a>The Start</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">Roughly 3 months ago, Me, Xander, Zealot and Dogman decided to create a server for the Official DarkRP Discord, at the start everyone was getting along, knocking out stuff that needed to be done. After a day or two, Woodrow decided to step in, at the start he was being perfectly A-OK, until we decided to go into a direction that he didn’t like (Modern DarkRP, he was under the assumption we were doing an old 2013~ DarkRP server, something “veteran” players could enjoy). When he realized we weren’t doing exactly what he wanted he well… started stifling progress, throwing a wrench in the works with his opposing views, although this would be normally great (like what everyone else was doing up to this point) he took a different approach, more aggressive and disruptive to the flow of things. Woodrow at this point hadn’t contributed nearly anything to the server (by nearly anything I mean anything), so we were understandably frustrated when he decided to play the role of the owner even though we had agreed previously to not being under the head/supervision of anyone besides each other (with the future exception of Zealot) and the votes.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="33" data-line-end="34">After the drama with Woodrow had started, we decided to create a new DarkRP discord just for the server as we wanted to involve Woodrow as little as possible in the development process due to his previous altercations with us and his lack of experience in DarkRP in the first place. Woodrow at this point was still bugging us, totally demotivating everyone who was working on it and pushing progress to a complete halt. After this happened it was really the end for the server, only being pushed along by Me and Xander who were continuing to work on the programming side of things in the hopes of starting up again. Around this time, Woodrow started pushing for the removal of the voting system we had in place on the Trello board which had been used to organize everything. At some point we regained motivation for the server and decided to work on it again.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="37" data-line-end="38">When we had started back up again, it was only for a brief amount of time before Woodrow used his hammer of being the self decided boss to kill the motivation again by not agreeing to simple terms that I had asked him to adhere to (something along the lines of agreeing hes not the boss of us and he has to work with us, not against us). After he decided to continue being stuck up, I left (something I had done several times before) for good, at that point it was totally done, a server which he had wanted done for a long time, which we offered to do for totally free he had ironically destroyed.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="47" data-line-end="48">As of about an hour of writing this (23 of January 2021 | 11:22 PM PST), I have been banned from the DarkRP Official Discord server for no other reasons besides calling him an “arrogant asshole”, and being kind of a dick to him (understandably because of my view of him after the server interactions). Im going to go through what he said point by point after he banned me, feel free to follow along, the screenshot is in the Information and Links footer below this.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="49" data-line-end="50">&lt;Discussion about why hammer sucks&gt;</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="51" data-line-end="54">Me: “Oh did you learn it in a week. arrogant asshole”<br>
Woodrow: “Yea now, I’ve been trying to get rid of you for like over a year now. please leave my existence”<br>
In regards to this, he has been trying to get rid of me for a year but I’ve done nothing but help him and his server grow over the year I’ve been there so it would be illogical to ban me, the “Oh did you learn it in a week” thing is a jab at Dogman, who claimed to be able to learn Lua in just one week (He got “burnt out” after about a month, barely being able to do anything).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="55" data-line-end="56">&lt;Banned here&gt;</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="59">Xander: “Why would you ban Orion”<br>
Woodrow: “Because the only reason he wasn’t banned before was Zealot made the incompetent decision to invite him on a project. He was literally on the to-ban list for nearly half a year now. He is hated by nearly the entire discord, dont even talk to me Xander. Sorry for being tired of tweedle dum over here”.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61">This is straight up illogical and factually wrong, Me, Xander and Dogman originally brought up the concept of the server to them, as it was something that Woodrow wanted done for a while it worked out great, Zealot wasnt a part of it until a few days after the fact, If hes counting one of the times I left and Zealot invited me back thats totally fair but this doesnt relate to Zealot at all, if anything that blame can go onto him. Also that “He is hated by nearly the entire Discord” statement is also wrong… right guys… right?</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="62" data-line-end="66">Xander: “You cant deny he was one of the smartest people in this Discord” UwU &lt;3<br>
Woodrow: “LLOL WHAT”<br>
Xander: “Yea he was toxic but he wasnt fuckin retarded like the rest of this ‘community’”<br>
Woodrow: “When did he ever demonstrate that he had any intelligence. Man we’ve got people like Quigly in here and you say that dumb shit, you’re funny thanks for the quick laugh my man, talk about “spewing shit”. Maybe you should look in the mirror before you break out the jackassery”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">Hes saying this like Quigly is the baseline of being smart, just because Quigly knows more than me doesnt mean that my intelligence is any less valid than his.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="72">Xander: “dude you’re such a terrible owner jesus christ”<br>
Blu: “Damn you still have your powertrips dont you ouch”<br>
Woodrow: “Ah yes ban someone that numerous people in the ‘community’ have wanted to be banned for months now, who literally was only not banned because of a mistake Zealot made. duHR PowErTrip”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">I haven’t met a single person in that Discord that’s wanted me banned seriously, I mean jokingly… sure but seriously no.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="80">Blu: “Its not the first time”<br>
Woodrow: “AH YES I AM XANDEDR, I REPRESONT THE PEEPL.  U HAVE BANT MY KINGD<br>
I’m always open to debate.  There has never been a single ban I’ve done that was not justified.<br>
Apologies if I don’t accept&quot;DUYHRRRR BAD ONWERR!!” as a valid anything<br>
If you want to incompetently spew rhetoric, you may do so, but it’s not going to achieve anything lol&quot;</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="81" data-line-end="82">This message is all wrong, starting with him saying that I’m Xanders King, even though it might be true doesn’t mean that its a valid point in this case, saying that hes defending me because I rule over him is stupid and wrong &lt;3. “I’m always open to debate”, if debate is eliminating the means of debate than sure he is (Removing Votes from the Trello, Not listening to other views, ect).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="83" data-line-end="87">Blu: “I mean all i see here is you started shittalking him then he shit talked back and you pissed yourself”<br>
Woodrow: “So you’re admitting ignorance that’s fine. If you didnt read the multiple messages i sent where Orion was on a ban list for literally months now thats fine too.”<br>
Blu: “why was he on the banlist”<br>
Woodrow: “Maybe just leave it to me to make that call instead of inserting yourself, ey?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="88" data-line-end="89">Ok im having a hard time keeping calm while going through this but ill try my best, first of all he was shittalking me, he has been for ages and i’ve retorted with more shittalking against him. And notice how he dodges the question of why he wanted to ban me, seems to me he just doesnt like me so he got rid of me.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91">&lt;Im skipping a few messages where he basically just retorts what he was saying before&gt;</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="92" data-line-end="96">Woodrow: “Nobody wanted him there. Nobody wanted him here.”<br>
Blu &amp; Xander: “i want him here” (&lt;3 u boys)<br>
Woodrow: “Youre a minority”<br>
Xander: “im sure half the people here arent active enough to know who he is and to have talked to him”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="97" data-line-end="98">Thats where the screenshot ends, and about him saying that noone wanted me there that’s obviously not true, I provided loads of help to most of the people there that actually needed help (I picked on new server owners who couldn’t do basic stuff), and he even said that Zealot wanted me there for a while (one of his own moderators).</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="108" data-line-end="109">My personal conclusion on this matter is that Woodrow is a power hungry Reddit Moderator who got a bit too big for his pants, Hes not trusting in the slightest nor friendly. As an example about him not being trusting, Moderators on the server cant even ban, this has caused issues in the past and we’ve told him about this quite a bit and hes refused to fix it.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="114" data-line-end="116">Well, first of all you could talk to Woodrow directly, he doesnt accept Friend Requests so I didnt include his Discord here but he owns this subreddit so feel free to spam him ;)<br>
Also feel welcomed to message Me or Xander about this matter, were happy to answer any questions or anything.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="117" data-line-end="119">Lastly you can simply give up on him, leave him totally and stop using things that he owns such as the Discord or Reddit.<br>
If youd like to join a DarkRP discord owned by people who are actually cool, feel free to <a href="https://discord.gg/CW8Pg3Xw">here</a>.</p>
